# Learning Bloom filter

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter#Algorithm_description>

<https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/92618/in-a-bloom-filter-why-does-the-optimal-number-of-hashes-increase-with-the-num> -> use more hash functions to get more "bits" in each "fingerprint" but balance it with competing factors in order to decrease chances of false positives.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hchiam/learning-bloom-filter.git && cd learning-bloom-filter && yarn
```

or

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hchiam/learning-bloom-filter.git && cd learning-bloom-filter && npm install
```

and then you can run the example file:

```bash
node index.js
```
